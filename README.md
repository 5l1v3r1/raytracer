# Raytracer

A raytracer made in Java, able to render images of 3D objects and handles
reflection, refraction and textures on plane surfaces.

# How to build

Just run `make` in the livrables/ directory.

# How to use

In the livrables/ directory, run `java -jar sources.jar` to use the GUI.

You can use the scene files in the livrables/tests/raytracer directory. Just press
`Voir l'image` to render the image.

# Example

Here is a movie made using the raytracer: http://vimeo.com/68362754

More than 4000 scene files, about 1,4Gb of images. Would be rendered in about
22 days on a usual computer, we made it in one night using all computers in our
school.
